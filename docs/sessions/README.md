# Session Logs

This directory contains development session logs documenting significant work sessions on the auto-drone project. Each session log captures the goals, decisions, implementation details, and outcomes of a focused development effort.

## Naming Convention

Session logs follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

Examples:
- `2024-12-08-phase2-waypoint-following.md`
- `2024-12-01-initial-skeleton.md`

## Session Log Template

Each session log should include:

1. **Session Info** - Date, duration estimate, focus area
2. **Goals** - What we set out to accomplish
3. **Key Decisions** - Architectural choices and rationale
4. **Implementation** - Files created/modified, code highlights
5. **Testing** - How the work was validated
6. **Issues Encountered** - Problems and their solutions
7. **Next Steps** - Follow-up work identified
